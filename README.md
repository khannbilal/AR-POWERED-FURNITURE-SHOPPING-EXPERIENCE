# AR-Powered Furniture Shopping Experience


 Overview
This project introduces an augmented reality (AR) application designed to revolutionize the online furniture shopping experience by enabling Realtime visualization of products within users’ physical environments. The system enhances consumer decision-making by bridging the gap between digital catalogs and spatial context, leading to measurable improvements in engagement, satisfaction, and reduced product returns.

Framework
Models/Engines: Unity 3D, ARKit (iOS), ARCore (Android)
Libraries/Tools: Python (backend), Blender (3D modelling), Firebase (cloud sync), OpenCV (surface detection), REST APIs

 Scope
 Develop an AR based mobile application for interactive product visualization.
 Implement object scaling, rotation, and surface anchoring in real time.
 Integrate dynamic lighting estimation for realistic rendering.
 Build a product catalog with metadata and texture optimization.
 Evaluate usability, engagement, and return rate metrics.

 Dataset
Name: Custom 3D Furniture Dataset
Description: A curated collection of 150+ high-fidelity 3D models representing diverse furniture categories (chairs, sofas, tables, beds).

Preprocessing Steps:
 Polygon optimization and UV mapping via Blender.
 Texture compression for mobile rendering performance.
 Surface and lighting calibration using ARKit/ARCore SDKs.

 Methodology

 1. Data Loading & Asset Preparation

 Furniture models imported from 3D asset library (GLTF/FBX format).
 Preprocessing pipeline optimized textures and meshes for mobile GPUs.

 2. Model Loading / AR Integration

 Unity engine integrated with ARKit/ARCore SDKs for surface detection and tracking.
 Implemented Realtime environment scanning using SLAM based depth mapping.

 3. Interaction Layer

 Gesture recognition for rotation, scaling, and repositioning.
 Ambient light adaptation for material shading realism.
 Collision detection to prevent object overlap.

 4. Backend & Analytics

 Python based backend with Firebase storage for user preferences.
 Analytics tracking for session duration, interactions, and conversion intent.

 5. Evaluation Metrics

 User Engagement Rate (% of interactive sessions).
 Placement Accuracy (measured in cm deviation).
 Rendering Latency (FPS consistency).
 Post purchase Return Rate (real-world evaluation metric).
